<h2>Contributing</h2>
<hr>
<p>If you want 
to contribute to a project and make 
it better, your help is very welcome.
 Contributing is also a
 great way to learn more about socia
 l coding on Github, new technologies
and their ecosystems and how to make c
onstructive, helpful bug reports, fea
ture requests and the
 noblest of all contributions: a good,
 clean pull request.</p>
 <h3>How to make a cl
 ean pull request</h3>
 <p>Look for a project's
 contribution i
 nstructions. If there are
 any, follow them.</p>
 <ul>
 	<li>Create a personal fork
  of the project on Github.</li>
 	<li>Clone the fork on your l
  ocal machine. Your remote repo on Gi
  thub is called origin.</li>
 	<li>Add the original repositor
  y as a remote called upstream.</li>
 	<li>If you created your fork a
  while ago be sure to pull upstream changes in
  to your local repository.</li>
 	<li>Create a new branch to wor
  k on! Branch from develop if it exists, else
  from master.</li>
 	<li>Implement/fix your feature,
  comment your code.</li>
 	<li>Follow the code style of
  the project, including indentation.</li>
 	<li>If the project has test
  s run them!</li>
 	<li>Write or adapt tests as 
  needed.</li>
 	<li>Add or change the docume
  ntation as needed.</li>
 	<li>Squash your commits int
  o a single commit with git's 
  <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-git-rebase/">interactive rebase</a>. 
  Create a new branch if necessary.</li>
 	<li>Push your branch to your
  fork on Github, the remote origin.</li>
 	<li>From your fork open a 
  pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's develop branch if there is one, else go for master!</li>
 	<li>Once the pull request i
  s approved and merged you can pull the changes from upstream to your local repo and delete your extra branch(es).</li>
 </ul>
 <p>And last but not least: Always write 
 your commit messages in the present tense. Your commit 
 message should describe what the commit, when applied, does to
 the code â€“ not what you did to the code.</p>
